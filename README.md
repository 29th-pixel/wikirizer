### Making a Telegram Bot to summarize Wikipedia text.

Summarization can be defined as a task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information and overall meaning. Here the I have used Extractive Summarization, which means that it reads the text and get the most important points added to the summary.
I have also make sure to include the 1 paragraph of every article to make the reference clear.

Users can also export the Summary to Text, PDF and Image files according to their needs which makes sharing of summary much easier.

This bot will be hosted in few days and become ready to use. You can add it to your Telegram by searching wikiSummarize_bot or following this link will take you directly to bot [wikiSummarize_bot](http://t.me/wikiSummarize_bot)
